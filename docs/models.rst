*Expand this section appropriately to describe the models you build*. **Any papers or AI tools used to assist you in creating your models should be described here and referenced appropriately.**

Risk Class Prediction Models
============================

All Zero Risk
-------------

This model assumes all unlabeled flood risk data is near zero risk (band 1, the modal class), which is the modal class for the data set, which is strongly unbalanced. This is a baseline model to compare against. While it achieve a moderately good accuracy, it is not a useful model for risk prediction, and has little skill.

House Price Prediction Models
=============================

All England median
------------------

This model assumes all unlabeled house price data is the median house price for England. This is a baseline model to compare against. While it achieve a moderately good accuracy, it is not a useful model for risk prediction, and has little skill.
